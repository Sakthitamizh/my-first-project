# my-first-project
This is my first project on GitHub
This is my first official project i have done during my Internship at Mentorness.
This is about Hotel Reservation Analysis.
I have been given with dataset with 700 reservations for the year 2017 and 2018.
In this project i have been given with 15 problem questions to find answers by using SQL queries.
Findings in this project: Most used meal type, most reserved room type, most used segment type, most bookings happened time etc.
